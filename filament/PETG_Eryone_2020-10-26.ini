# Description: Black Eryone PETG filament
# Purchased: 2020-10-26
#
# Notes: Temperature tower 97325543cbbabd13c9525ed83ec2aad9b137aca38199b85b049f1dcebf8bd78c
#        printed in enclosure at 50°C ambient showed a couple of strands of
#        bridging failure at 240°C and at 260°C. Bridging at other temperatures
#        was fine.
#
#        Stringing did not appear until 235°C and became more pronounced at
#        each temperature increment. Stringing at 260°C was still acceptable.
#        Unfortunately, the resulting tower print was brittle and cracked
#        at the top of the 240°C floor when stressed by hand.
#
#        Test prints of 80x15x15mm rods at 235°C with 10% honeycomb infill and
#        three perimeters were easily crushed with pliers whereas the same test
#        prints with Prusa PLA could not be crushed at all.
#
#        On a stock Prusa i3, printed in an enclosure at 50°C ambient, the
#        settings that produced a 80x15x15mm rod that could not be crushed with
#        pliers in any direction (or even significantly dented) were:
#
#          Infill overlap:       55%
#          Infill:               15% cubic
#          Extruder Temperature: 230°C first layer, 235°C rest
#          Bed Temperature:      85°C first layer, 90°C rest
#          Perimeters:           3
#          Fans:                 25%
#          Print speed:          25mm/s.
