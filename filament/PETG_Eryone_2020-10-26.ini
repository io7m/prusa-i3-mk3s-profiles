# Description: Black Eryone PETG filament
# Purchased: 2020-10-26
#
# Notes: Temperature tower 97325543cbbabd13c9525ed83ec2aad9b137aca38199b85b049f1dcebf8bd78c
#        printed in enclosure at 50°C ambient showed a couple of strands of
#        bridging failure at 240°C and at 260°C. Bridging at other temperatures
#        was fine.
#
#        Stringing did not appear until 235°C and became more pronounced at
#        each temperature increment. Stringing at 260°C was still acceptable.
#        Unfortunately, the resulting tower print was brittle and cracked
#        at the top of the 240°C floor when stressed by hand.
#
#        Subsequent testing has shown the best layer adhesion to occur at 240°C,
#        and sufficient part detail is achieved with a 15% fan.
#
#        The extrusion multiplier was calculated by printing a 0.5mm thick
#        vase-mode cube.
#
