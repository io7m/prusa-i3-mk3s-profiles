# Notes: Temperature tower 97325543cbbabd13c9525ed83ec2aad9b137aca38199b85b049f1dcebf8bd78c
#        printed in enclosure at 50°C ambient showed a couple of strands of
#        bridging failure at 240°C and at 260°C. Bridging at other temperatures
#        was fine.
#
#        Stringing did not appear until 235°C and became more pronounced at
#        each temperature increment. Stringing at 260°C was still acceptable.
#        Unfortunately, the resulting tower print was brittle and cracked
#        at the top of the 240°C floor when stressed by hand.
#
#        Test prints of 80x15x15mm rods at 235°C with 10% honeycomb infill and
#        three perimeters were easily crushed with pliers whereas the same test
#        prints with Prusa PLA could not be crushed at all.
